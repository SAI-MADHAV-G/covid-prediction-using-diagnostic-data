Dataset

This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

One of the motivations for this challenge is the fact that in the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.
